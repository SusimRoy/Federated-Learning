# Federated-Learning

This repo contains a scratch implementation of the FedAvg algorithm on three different datasets to three different clients.
The datasets were MNIST, Colored MNIST and SVHN.

I also compare with a baseline implementation where I train in a non-federated manner on the combined dataset.

## How to run?
Run all the cells in the .ipynb files one by one.
